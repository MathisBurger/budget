# Budget

A simple application for nearly automating your monthly financial household stats.

## Information

This project is specifically built for comdirect CSV exports and compatibility to other formats is not guranteed.
But if there is interest other banks can be added. Just create an issue and I will take a look at it.

# Usage 

Using the application is quite simple:

```shell
budget <path-to-config> <path-to-export>
```
